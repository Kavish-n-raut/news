                <p>
                    Indian markets opened on a positive note as TCS announced a ₹15,000 crore share buyback and HDFC Bank posted double-digit growth in net income. Analysts say IT and banking sectors may drive short-term momentum.

                    <div class="sub-news-item">
                        <p>Indian markets opened on a strong note today, buoyed by positive cues emerging from heavyweight sectors, particularly technology and banking. Among the early movers, Tata Consultancy Services attracted investor interest following a series of corporate developments that signaled continued confidence from the company’s leadership. While the specifics were not fully disclosed in initial exchanges, market participants noted increased activity around the stock, suggesting that institutional investors were responding favorably to the latest board decisions and forward-looking commentary.
In parallel, HDFC Bank provided further support to the benchmark indices after releasing an encouraging business update earlier this week. The lender highlighted steady improvement in key financial metrics, including a healthy expansion in income streams and consistent loan book growth. These indicators have reinforced analysts’ views that the banking major remains well-positioned to sustain its earnings momentum in the coming quarters.
Together, the twin pillars of IT and banking helped lift early trading sentiment, with both sectors contributing meaningfully to index gains. Broader market participation also improved as investors anticipated that strong performances from these industry leaders could spill over into related segments.
However, analysts remain watchful of global factors, noting that volatility in international markets could influence domestic sentiment later in the week. For now, though, the upbeat signals from TCS and HDFC Bank appear to be setting the tone for a constructive start to the trading day.<br>

TCS opened the day with a strong 3% jump as investors reacted positively to early optimism around its quarterly outlook. However, the stock later trimmed most of its gains after internal reports suggested that a major North American project rollout could face scheduling delays. The update tempered sentiment among institutional buyers, who had been expecting faster execution progress. Despite the pullback, analysts believe the long-term demand environment for TCS’s digital services remains largely intact.

HDFC Bank touched a fresh 52-week high after posting stellar operating metrics, supported by strong loan growth and improved interest income. The upbeat performance boosted overall banking sentiment, although Axis Bank moved in the opposite direction. Axis slipped nearly 1% as the market digested higher-than-expected provisioning costs outlined in its latest update. Analysts noted that while HDFC Bank continues to deliver consistent results, Axis Bank may face near-term pressure as it restructures certain stressed assets.

Tech Mahindra traded lower throughout the session after management issued softer-than-expected guidance on future order inflows. The company indicated that deal closures in key international markets could take longer due to enterprise spending cuts, dampening investor confidence. The stock’s weakness limited broader gains in the IT index, which had otherwise opened firm on strength in TCS. Market experts believe Tech Mahindra may continue to see volatility until clearer visibility emerges on its large-deal pipeline.
