                    Cipla fell 3% after reports of regulatory concerns, while Hero MotoCorp shares declined amid weak rural demand. Broader indices remained range-bound with mixed sectoral performance.

                        <p> Indian equities traded largely range-bound today as weakness in select heavyweight sectors offset early optimism. The pharmaceutical and automobile spaces were among the key drags, limiting broader market advances and keeping benchmark indices within a narrow band.
The auto sector also lost momentum as Hero MotoCorp declined amid persistent concerns over muted rural demand. Analysts highlighted that uneven monsoon distribution and higher input costs continue to constrain purchasing power in rural markets, which form a large portion of the company’s customer base. This, combined with slower-than-expected recovery in entry-level motorcycle sales, added pressure on the stock.
Despite these weaknesses, pockets of buying were visible in select financial and IT names, helping prevent a sharper market decline. However, the mixed sectoral performance and lack of strong directional cues kept overall sentiment cautious as traders awaited further clarity from global and domestic economic data releases.
Sub News-
Cipla’s Goa manufacturing facility had received an FDA inspection notice. While details of the observations were not immediately disclosed, the development triggered concerns about potential compliance issues and future product approvals from the site. Traders noted that the stock had shown relative strength in recent sessions, prompting some profit-booking. Analysts say clarity on the inspection outcome will determine near-term direction for the pharmaceutical major.

Hero MotoCorp extended its weakness as worries over sluggish rural demand continued to weigh on two-wheeler sales. Analysts highlight that uneven monsoon progress and rising costs have limited purchasing power in key non-urban markets. In contrast, Maruti Suzuki advanced nearly 2% after securing strong export orders for its compact and mid-size models. The divergence within the auto sector kept overall sentiment mixed, with investors becoming more selective within mobility-related stocks.

Sun Pharma saw mild gains after receiving a positive communication from the USFDA regarding its Tandal facility. Market participants interpreted the update as a step toward resolving pending compliance issues, improving visibility for upcoming product launches. Although the stock’s move was modest, analysts said the development reinforces confidence in Sun Pharma’s regulatory trajectory. The update also helped offset broader weakness in some other pharma names, lending slight support to the sector.
