                <h2>FMCG & Retail Mixed on Demand Signals</h2>
                <p>The FMCG and retail sectors delivered a mixed performance in today's trade as investors weighed contrasting demand indicators from leading consumer-facing companies. While some players reported resilient momentum in key product categories, others faced pressure from rising input costs and uneven discretionary spending patterns.</p>
                <p>ITC and DMart were among the notable gainers, supported by improving consumer sentiment in urban markets. ITC benefited from positive commentary around its non-cigarette segments, particularly agri and paperboards, which continue to deliver steady volumes despite broader macro uncertainty. DMart, meanwhile, saw interest from long-term investors who expect demand to remain stable even as short-term metrics appear slightly soft.</p>
                <p>On the flip side, staples giants Hindustan Unilever and Nestlé India dragged the sector lower. HUL came under pressure as the sudden rise in palm oil prices raised concerns about margin compression in its personal care and home care portfolios. Nestlé India faced a sharper sell-off after the company became embroiled in controversy related to alleged misleading health claims on one of its cereal brands, prompting regulatory scrutiny and denting near-term sentiment.</p>
                <p>Overall, traders described consumer demand as "patchy," with premium urban categories performing better than mass-market segments. Analysts expect the sector to remain stock-specific until clearer trends emerge.</p>

                    <h3>🔍 Key Developments:</h3>
                    <div class="sub-news-item">
                        <p><span class="emoji">🚬</span> <strong>ITC</strong> gained around 2% after multiple brokerages upgraded the stock, citing strong performance in its agri and paperboard divisions. Analysts highlighted that both segments continue to benefit from robust export orders and steady domestic demand. The upgrades helped offset concerns around near-term FMCG volatility. Investors also viewed ITC's diversified revenue streams as an advantage in a market where input cost pressures are affecting several peers.</p>

                    <div class="sub-news-item">
                        <p><span class="emoji">🏬</span> <strong>DMart</strong> traded largely flat as the retailer reported sequential moderation in same-store sales growth. While footfall trends remained stable, analysts noted that spending per customer showed signs of cooling in select categories. Despite the softer numbers, investors maintained confidence in DMart's long-term expansion strategy and efficient cost structure. Market experts said the stock may stay range-bound until stronger demand indicators emerge.</p>

                        <p><span class="emoji">🧴</span> <strong>Hindustan Unilever</strong> slipped about 1.5% after palm oil prices surged, raising concerns over margin pressure in its personal care and home care businesses. The commodity is a key raw material for several of HUL's flagship products. Analysts noted that the company may need to adjust pricing strategies if input cost inflation persists. The stock saw mild profit-booking as traders reassessed near-term earnings visibility.</p>

                        <p><span class="emoji">🥣</span> <strong>Nestlé India</strong> dropped nearly 3% after facing backlash over allegedly misleading health claims linked to one of its cereal brands. Early reports suggested that consumer groups and regulatory bodies may seek clarification from the company, sparking concerns over potential reputational impact. The development led to increased selling pressure, particularly from short-term traders. Analysts said the stock may remain volatile until the issue receives formal resolution or clarification.</p>
