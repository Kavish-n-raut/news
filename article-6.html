                <h2>Energy Stocks in Focus as Crude Slide Boosts Refining Margins</h2>
                <p>
                    Energy stocks were at the center of market attention today, with several key names witnessing notable movement after crude oil prices registered a sharp overnight decline. The drop in global crude benchmarks provided a direct boost to downstream players, improving expectations for refining and marketing margins across the sector.

                <p>
                    Reliance Industries analysts noted that lower crude prices typically support the company's integrated refining and petrochemical businesses, offering a short-term uplift to profitability. Sentiment also improved around its oil-to-chemicals operations, which tend to benefit when feedstock costs ease.

                    ONGC also advanced more than 2%, though for a slightly different set of reasons. While lower crude prices generally weigh on upstream earnings, the market viewed the recent decline as temporary and instead focused on ONGC's broader production guidance and steady operational updates. The stock saw healthy buying interest from domestic institutions, who expect stability in the company's long-term revenue trajectory.

                    In contrast, Power Grid Corporation slipped after news emerged about delays in certain transmission projects. Concerns around execution timelines and potential cost overruns pressured the stock, offsetting some of the sector's gains. Despite mixed moves, energy remained one of the most actively traded segments of the session.

                        <p><span class="emoji">🏭</span> <strong>Reliance Industries</strong> gained nearly 2.5% as investors reacted positively to an improvement in global refining spreads, which typically enhances profitability for its oil-to-chemicals business. Market participants noted increased buying interest after early trade data indicated stronger margins across key product categories. Analysts said the company is well-positioned to benefit if the current trend in feedstock prices continues, with several brokerages revising short-term earnings expectations upward. The stock remained one of the top contributors to index gains.</p>

                        <p><span class="emoji">🛢️</span> <strong>ONGC</strong> moved higher after the company reported a new exploration success in Assam, reinforcing confidence in its ability to expand domestic reserves. The discovery, though preliminary, boosted sentiment around the company's long-term production outlook. Traders noted increased institutional participation, interpreting the update as a supportive factor at a time when global energy prices remain volatile. Analysts believe the new find could further strengthen ONGC's strategic position within India's upstream energy landscape.</p>

                        <p><span class="emoji">⚡</span> <strong>Power Grid Corporation</strong> slipped around 1.8% after reports pointed to equipment supply delays affecting two major transmission projects. The news raised concerns about potential timeline extensions and minor cost overruns, prompting selective profit-taking in the stock. Market watchers said that while the company retains a strong execution track record, disruptions of this nature tend to weigh on near-term sentiment. Analysts expect clarity on revised schedules in the coming weeks, which may influence further price action.</p>

Although no official confirmation has been issued, the possibility of strategic sale discussions resurfacing kept traders cautious. The stock saw alternating bouts of buying and selling as investors assessed the implications of potential ownership changes. Analysts noted that clarity from policymakers will be crucial in determining the stock's next meaningful direction.</p>
