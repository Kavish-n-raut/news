                <h2>Cement Sector Turns Bullish</h2>
                <p>The cement sector recorded strong gains in today's session after the government unveiled a massive ₹1 lakh crore infrastructure development fund, aimed at accelerating nationwide projects in housing, transportation, and urban renewal. The announcement sparked renewed optimism across construction-related industries, with cement manufacturers emerging as some of the biggest beneficiaries of the policy boost.</p>
                <p>UltraTech Cement posted solid advances as investors priced in the likelihood of sustained volume growth over the coming quarters. Analysts noted that the fund is expected to directly support demand for premium cement grades, particularly in large metro and semi-urban development projects. With UltraTech's strong distribution network and capacity expansion plans, the company is seen as well-positioned to capture a sizable share of upcoming contracts.</p>
                <p>Ambuja Cements also gained sharply, supported by expectations of increased government-led construction activity and improving order inflows from road and housing segments. Market commentators highlighted that Ambuja's efficient cost structure and ongoing modernization initiatives could further enhance margins as demand accelerates.</p>
                <p>Broader sentiment in the sector remained upbeat, with several mid-cap cement producers also witnessing renewed buying interest. Analysts believe the newly announced infrastructure push will provide long-term visibility for construction-linked companies, potentially setting the stage for a multi-quarter growth cycle in the cement industry.</p>
                <div class="sub-news">
                    <h3>🔍 Key Developments:</h3>
                    <div class="sub-news-item">
                        <p><span class="emoji">🏭</span> <strong>UltraTech Cement</strong> advanced nearly 4% after the company confirmed plans to set up a new manufacturing plant in Odisha, further strengthening its presence in the eastern region. The expansion aligns with its broader capacity growth strategy aimed at capturing rising demand from infrastructure and housing projects. Investors responded positively to the announcement, viewing it as a sign of continued confidence in the sector's long-term outlook. Analysts expect the new facility to support volume growth once operational.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-news-item">
                        <p><span class="emoji">📈</span> <strong>Ambuja Cements</strong> gained close to 3% as buying interest returned to large cement producers following renewed optimism in the sector. However, Shree Cement slipped around 1% after the abrupt resignation of its Chief Financial Officer, who stepped down citing personal reasons. The leadership change sparked brief uncertainty among investors, prompting selective profit-booking. Despite the dip, analysts believe Shree Cement's fundamentals remain strong, with sentiment likely to stabilize once a replacement is announced.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-news-item">
                        <p><span class="emoji">💼</span> Analysts maintained a positive outlook on the cement sector despite ongoing concerns around cost inflation, particularly in fuel and logistics expenses. They noted that strong demand visibility from housing, road construction, and government-led infrastructure projects should offset near-term margin pressures. Brokerage houses emphasized that companies with efficient cost structures and expansion plans are better positioned to navigate volatility. Overall, the sentiment remains constructive for the medium to long term.</p>
